rice challenges and projects

In this challenge, we were called to refactor aspects of the html to ensure that the site responds appropriately to certain interaction within the page. Along with refactoring, ensuring that the css style sheet corresponds with each element according to the html. I was able to determine the main issues within the html, ensure the style sheet's correspondence, and add labels to each function within the html. With the goal of retrieval, refactoring, inspection, and completion, I believe I have successfully optimized the site to the best of my ability.

** I HAD TO START ALL MY REPOSITORIES OVER. I WAS HAVING AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TROUBLE WITH COMMITING GIT**
**   AND PUSHING DUE TO DISSONANCE IN DIRECTORY/FILE CREATION. I HOPE TO HAVE A RESPECTABLE COLLECTION OF  **     
**     REPOSITORIES SO AS TO ENSURE PROPER GRADING AND VIEWING. I SIMPLY TYPE THIS AS A PLEA FOR MERCY     **
